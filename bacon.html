          <h2>DESIGNING A P2P MOBILE APPLICATION</h2>
          <p>(Due to confidentiality, some content may be withheld or altered.)</p>
          <p>I was given the task to design a peer-to-peer payment application similar to Venmo, Zelle, and PayPal.
            Designs would be used by management to present the product to potential clients and by the development team to understand the application.</p>

    <!-- About Bacon -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>WHAT IS BACON?</h2>
      <p>Bacon is a faster payments ecosystem that consists of four payment modules: P2P, C2B, B2C, and B2B. Bacon utilizes the "Most Feasible Routing" payment structure. It takes into account speed, cost, and network when routing payments.</p>
      <p>The Bacon network would include financial institutions that utilize VSoft's digital banking platform. Much like Zelle is to Wells Fargo and other banks. Bacon would also be available to those outside the network. </p>
    </div>


    <!-- Design Objective -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>DESIGN OBJECTIVE</h2>
      <p>As the designer, my goal was not to completely redesign the P2P payment application but to improve and extend upon the designs of existing P2P apps to meet the product's requirements and features.
        Bacon is about providing the most efficient routing, so the user experience should represent a seamless transaction. </p>
      <p>Let's take a look at a few existing P2P apps:</p>
      <p><b>Venmo</b> makes payments fun & social. You can see your friend's payments, and the use of emojis are encouraged. </p>
      <p><b>Zelle</b> brings you through the process one step at a time. It provides the most seamless user experience due to its minimal and direct user flow. The user only has to worry about one thing on each page. </p>
      <p><b>PayPal</b> offers a more holistic view of your account. The home page provides your recent activity, quick pay, balance, and payment options</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 images">
          <img src="images/venmo.jpg" alt="Venmo">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 images">
          <img src="images/zelle.png" alt="Zelle">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 images">
          <img src="images/paypal.png" alt="Paypal">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I decided to take Zelle's payment/request flow, but with PayPal's feature accessible home page. I wanted users to have easy access to their QR code, Bacon Balance, pending requests, and recent activity, while also being able to easily locate
        the payment/request actions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Process -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>PROCESS</h2>

      <ol class="small-header">
        <li>Wire-Framing</li>
        <li>Positive flow Mockups</li>
        <li>High-Fidelity Interactive Prototype</li>
        <li>Design edge/empty cases</li>
        <li>Finalize & document designs</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Throughout the process, we went through several designs for the home page such as the following images. We initially wanted to include the information of recent activity and incoming request. However, even though the information is
        important, it did clutter the page which can be distracting for the user.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 images">
          <img src="images/bacon-mockup-1.png" alt="Mockup 1">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 images">
          <img src="images/bacon-mockup-2.png" alt="Mockup 2">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Final Design -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>FINAL DESIGN</h2>
      <p>For the final design of the home page, I eliminated the cluttering information, but I did include buttons that link to the information so the user would still have direct access to it. I wanted the primary focus to be on the payment/request
        action buttons. I designed the buttons to be white and in the middle of the page with plenty of negative space around them. The design in minimal and direct.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 images">

      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Extra Bacon -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>EXTRA BACON</h2>
      <p>I can't show all the screens for this app, but here is a prototype that shows how someone who is not registered on Bacon would receive a payment from a Bacon user. Registered users are able to sends payments to a mobile number or email. This
        allows for a seamless transaction where the receiver does not need to download the Bacon app to receive the payment.</p>
